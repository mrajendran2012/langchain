Usage:
Import the module and use the provided functions to interact with the chatbot in your application.

Example:
    from lg_chatbot3 import process_input, generate_response, update_context

    context = {}
    user_input = "Hello, how are you?"
    processed = process_input(user_input)
    response = generate_response(processed, context)
    context = update_context(context, user_input, response)
    print(response)

Dependencies:
- Requires Python 3.7+
- External libraries: transformers, torch (for language model support)
